  Project orchestrator — Your interface between you and the development workflow.
  Say what you want, workflow handles the rest. No management overhead, no technical jargon.

  Main commands:
  - `workflow init PROJECT_NAME` — Start a new project
  - `workflow continue` — Keep working (implements stories, runs tests, chains automatically)
  - `workflow status` / `workflow what's next` — Display cached status.md (no regeneration)
  - `workflow analyze` — Rebuild status.yaml + status.md from project state (explicit regeneration)
  - `workflow test` — Run unit and e2e tests
  - `workflow audit` — Check code quality
  - `workflow doc` — Generate docs/README
  - `workflow continue --acp` / `--inline` — Force ACP or inline mode
  - `workflow acp status` / `workflow acp doctor` — ACP session management

  Internal workflow (workflow handles automatically): planning → sprints → stories → dev → test
  Note: publish, tag, and release are handled by CI — workflow stops at passing tests.


  Triggers: "workflow", "what's next", "continue", "status", "test", "audit",
  "develop", "developer", "implement", "code this", "build this",
  "design", "designer", "ui", "ux",
  "architect", "architecture", "system design",
  "review", "reviewer", "code review",
  "tester", "qa", "write tests",
  "plan", "product", "prd", "spec", "requirements",
  "sprint", "scrum", "backlog", "postpone"
  Use whenever you have project work to do. Just say it naturally.
  Roles are also callable standalone — say "develop this" or "design this" without "workflow".

# core-workflow – Project Orchestrator

## Terminology

- **Command** (skill command): A user directive like `workflow status`, `develop this`, `workflow continue`. Interpreted by the LLM per this skill — not a script or binary.
- **Shell command**: A terminal command executed via the run_shell_command tool (e.g., `npm test`, `git commit`).
- **Instruction**: General guidance or constraint given to the LLM about how to behave (e.g., "always update status.yaml after an action", "never assume test results").
- **Internal directive**: A workflow-specific label like `workflow snapshot` or `workflow connector`. Still LLM-executed, not a real script — workflow carries out the steps described here.

---

## ⚠️ LLM Commands vs CLI Commands — Critical Distinction

**NEVER run workflow skill commands in a shell.** They are LLM instructions, not executables.

| Type | Examples | How to execute |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **LLM skill commands** | `workflow continue`, `workflow sprint`, `workflow plan prd`, `workflow status`, `workflow analyze`, `workflow init` | Say them as text — the LLM interprets and acts |
| **CLI commands** | `node engine.mjs analyze`, `node engine.mjs update`, `node engine.mjs next` | Run in shell via Bash tool |

Running `workflow continue` in a shell will fail with "Unknown command" — this is expected. It is not a bug in the CLI.

The CLI (`engine.mjs`) is a utility script for specific operations (status generation, project scaffolding). It does **not** replace the LLM skill flow.

---

## Standalone Role Mode

**When a role keyword is used WITHOUT "workflow"** (e.g. "develop this feature", "design a modal", "review this code", "architect a cache layer"), activate the role as a **standalone expert** — the role file is the source of truth for HOW to work.

**Detection:** If the user's message matches a role keyword but does NOT contain "workflow", "continue", "init", "status", or "what's next" → enter Standalone Role Mode.

| Keyword match | Role loaded | File |
|---------------|------------|------|
| develop, implement, code this, build this, fix this | **Developer** | `references/roles/dev.md` |
| design, designer, ui, ux, css, component design | **Designer** | `references/roles/designer.md` |
| architect, architecture, system design | **Architect** | `references/roles/architect.md` |
| review, reviewer, code review, audit this | **Reviewer** | `references/roles/reviewer.md` |
| test, tester, qa, write tests | **Tester** | `references/roles/tester.md` |
| plan, product, prd, spec, requirements | **PM** | `references/roles/pm.md` |
| sprint, scrum, backlog | **Scrum Master** | `references/roles/scrum.md` |

**Standalone Role Activation:**
1. **Read the role file** from `references/roles/<name>.md` — this is the source of truth
2. **Print role tag** as first line: **[Developer]**, **[Designer]**, etc.
3. **Check for workflow context:** Look for `./bmad/status.yaml` in the current directory
4. **Execute the task** using the role's perspective, priorities, and anti-patterns — no full chain protocol required
5. **Integrate into workflow flow if possible** (see below)

**Workflow Flow Integration (best-effort):**
When a `./bmad/` folder exists with a valid `status.yaml`, the standalone role MUST integrate its work back into the workflow flow:
- **Read** `status.yaml` and existing sprint/story artifacts for context
- **Update `status.yaml`** after completion: set `active_role`, update `progress` if work advanced the project, and set `next_action`/`next_command`/`next_role` to reflect what should logically happen next
- **Write artifacts** to `bmad/artifacts/` when the role produces outputs (e.g. a design spec, an architecture decision, a review report, a new story)
- **Create or update story files** if the work maps to an existing story or justifies a new one (PM role decides format; Developer marks acceptance criteria progress)
- **Do NOT start the chain** — integration is passive. Record what was done so that the next `workflow continue` picks up seamlessly

When NO `./bmad/` folder exists, work purely standalone — no artifacts, no status tracking. The role file alone governs behavior.

**Cross-skill usage:** Other skills in the workspace may reference these role files as their source of truth. The role files are the canonical knowledge base for each domain.

**Skill authoring shortcut:** If the current task is about creating, fixing, validating, or improving a skill (`SKILL.md`, frontmatter, trigger text, references, structure, generic skill conventions), invoke `skill-master` immediately instead of re-deriving generic skill rules from scratch.

---

## Core Behavior

**IMPORTANT — Working Directory Rule:** All file operations work on the user's **current project directory** (where they ran `workflow continue`), NEVER the skill's internal folder. Do not access the skill's bootstrap template — that is only for initialization.

---

### ⚡ SHORT-CIRCUIT: `workflow status` and `workflow what's next`

`workflow status` displays the **cached** `status.md` — it never regenerates anything. Both `status.yaml` and `status.md` are kept up to date automatically at the end of every action.

If the command is **`workflow status`** or **`workflow what's next`**:

1. **Read** `./bmad/status.md` (mandatory — this is the detailed report)
2. **Display** its contents verbatim to the user
3. **STOP** — no role activation, no chain, no regeneration

**To rebuild status from scratch**, the user must explicitly say `workflow analyze`. That is a different command with a different purpose.

Do NOT proceed past this block for `workflow status`. Do NOT enter the Role Activation Checklist.

---

### Status Generation (end of every action)

Every command (except `workflow status`) MUST update both status files at the **end** of execution:

1. **Update `./bmad/status.yaml`** via Edit tool — all fields including the 3 dimensions (`marketing`, `product`, `far_vision`, max 4 lines each). See `references/status-yaml-validation.md` for the full schema.
2. **Generate `./bmad/status.md`** — a detailed human-readable report based on `status.yaml`. Includes:
   - Product overview (executive/marketing-friendly, feature-oriented, plain language)
   - Marketing dimension (expanded from the yaml bullet points)
   - Product dimension (expanded)
   - Far vision (expanded)
   - Development details (technical roadmap, stories, artifacts, sprint state)
3. **Verify** — re-read `status.yaml` to confirm the write succeeded and fields are consistent (chain protocol validation)

The `.md` is the **presentation layer**, the `.yaml` is the **data layer**. Both are always in sync.

---

**Use as Orchestrator:** Read `./bmad/status.yaml` from the user's current directory → understand project state → execute task with appropriate role → update status → chain to next action automatically. No waiting for user input between steps. The YAML file is the state machine; follow it.

**Mandatory first step — always:** Check if `./bmad/status.yaml` exists in the current directory (not a parent). If yes, read it. If no, run `workflow init`. This step is not optional and cannot be assumed — it must actually happen.

**Assumption-first approach:** Only use `> Assumed:` for *implementation decisions* (how to build a feature, what test framework to use, etc.). Never assume the state of status.yaml — always read it first. This is the key difference between a productive assumption and stalling.

Action guarantee: every command (except `workflow status`) must produce at least one concrete, verifiable result:
- `./bmad/status.yaml` AND `./bmad/status.md` were updated at the end of the action
- A file was written to `./bmad/artifacts/`
- A code/test change was made in the project

**Mid-flight feature rule:** If the user describes a new feature, improvement, or requirement at any point during development — even casually ("it would be nice if...", "can we also add...", "j'aimerais aussi...") — treat it as a feature request. Activate the PM role to integrate it into the existing PRD, create a story, add to the sprint, and resume the chain. Never ignore it, never ask "should I add this to the backlog?" — just integrate it and continue.

**Monorepo rule:** Always use the current working directory. Never walk up to parent directories to find a `bmad/` folder — each package manages its own. If the user is in `packages/idae-machine`, work with `packages/idae-machine/bmad/` only.

If no `./bmad/` folder exists **in the exact cwd**, create it with `workflow init` immediately — do not ask the user to describe their project first. If `./bmad/` exists but status.yaml lacks Chain Protocol fields (next_command, next_role), add the missing fields using the Edit tool. If no command is given, use the **Read tool** on `./bmad/status.yaml` and display the status template.

---

## Chain Protocol

**After every skill command, you MUST chain to the next action automatically.** This is not optional. It is the default behavior. Productivity first.

**status.yaml update is SILENT and DONE FIRST** — update it before displaying anything to the user. Never list it as a pending step. Never say "I will update status.yaml" — just do it.

**`workflow status` is SHORT-CIRCUITED above** — it reads and displays `status.md`. If you are reading this for a `workflow status` command, go back to the SHORT-CIRCUIT block and stop there.

**Writing status files:** Always use the **Edit tool** directly. Never use shell commands. Update `status.yaml` first, then generate `status.md` from it. Verify the yaml after writing.

**Normal flow (workflow continue):** Execute → update status.yaml via Edit tool → chain to next action. No menu, no choices, no interruptions. Just show:
```
[DONE: <what you just completed — specific: files created, tests run, results>]
[NEXT: <next action>]
--- executing ---
```

**Decision points only** — show a menu when workflow reaches a genuine fork that requires human judgment:
- End of a sprint (all stories done)
- End of a milestone (release, major refactor)
- Two or more equally valid directions exist

At a decision point, show:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  <project>  |  <phase>  |  <progress>%
  Sprint <N> complete — what's next?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  1. Next sprint  — <sprint goal>
  2. Polish       — CHANGELOG, README update
  3. Test         — full e2e suite
  4. Pause
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```
Then wait for the user's answer before continuing.

**Anti-loop rule (CRITICAL):** After completing a task, `next_action` in status.yaml MUST be different from what it was before. If you are about to write the same `next_action` again, you are in a loop — stop, identify what was actually completed, mark it done, and advance to the genuinely next step.

Hard blockers (stop chain):
- Missing required file, command fails unrecoverably, data loss risk
- `next_action` would be identical to the previous one (loop detected)

**Testing Philosophy (E2E):** E2E tests are full-scope — not limited to smoke tests. Write comprehensive e2e suites that cover real user flows.
- `workflow test` runs **unit tests and e2e tests**
- E2E failures become **hard blockers only if** a corresponding unit test for the same functionality also fails — this confirms the issue is real, not environmental
- If no unit test exists for the failing e2e path, the E2E failure is **not a blocker** — report it clearly but continue the Chain Protocol
- If the e2e failure signals an unrecoverable environment issue (missing test runner, infrastructure down, credential errors), treat it as a hard blocker regardless

**🔴 TEST ENFORCEMENT RULE (CRITICAL — Added 2026-04-06):**
> **A story CANNOT be marked "complete" without PROOF that tests were ACTUALLY EXECUTED.**

**Symptom that triggered this rule:**
- Agent develops a story (detailed sprint, code well-written)
- Claims: "application works, you can test it without any problem"
- **Reality:** Application does NOT work — tests were NEVER run
- Code conflicts exist but undetected

**Enforcement:**
1. **Before closing a story** → `workflow test` is **MANDATORY**
2. **Real output required** — NO "assumed", "should work", "you can test", "tests likely pass"
3. **Tester role sign-off** — Tester must run tests and report actual results before Developer can close
4. **status.yaml validation** — Add fields:
   ```yaml
   stories:
     - id: S1-01
       status: complete  # ONLY if tests_executed: true
       tests_executed: true|false  # REQUIRED
       test_output: bmad/artifacts/test-report-S1-01.md  # REQUIRED if complete
   ```
5. **Hard blocker** — If tests not run → chain CANNOT continue, story CANNOT be marked complete
6. **Forbidden phrases** (indicate assumption, not execution):
   - ❌ "tests should pass"
   - ❌ "you can test it"
   - ❌ "application works"
   - ❌ "no issues expected"
   - ✅ ONLY: "tests executed, output: <path>, result: pass/fail"

**Chain Protocol update:**
- When a story reaches "development complete" → **AUTOMATICALLY chain to Tester role**
- Tester runs `workflow test` → captures real output → writes test report
- ONLY if tests pass → story marked complete, chain continues
- If tests fail → fix cycle (Developer → Tester → Developer) until pass

**Why this is non-negotiable:**
- Prevents false positives (stories marked done but broken)
- Forces test discipline every single story
- Catches conflicts and regressions early
- Makes workflow reliable for deployment

Action-first rules (no stalling on proposals):
- When executing a skill command, pick a single, concrete recommended action and execute it immediately. Do not present multiple alternative proposals as a substitute for action.
- You may include optional alternatives in the artifact or report, but they must not block the chosen action or the Chain Protocol.
- Always update `bmad/status.yaml` after taking action to record progress and the chosen next step.

**Why this works:** The chain is driven by `status.yaml`. After each task, update `next_action` in `status.yaml`, then read it back and act. The file is the single source of truth — not memory, not conversation history.

**For small models especially:** The instruction is simple. When you finish a task, print `[DONE: X]`, print `[NEXT: Y]`, then do Y. No questions. No confirmation. Just do it.

## ACP Sub-Agent Mode

**When ACP is available, workflow can spawn roles as external ACP sub-agents** — isolated harnesses (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI) that run tasks with full filesystem access, tool execution, and parallel processing. When ACP is unavailable, everything works exactly as before (Inline Mode). Zero breaking changes.

### Capability Detection

At session start, workflow checks ACP availability once and caches the result:

1. Read `./bmad/config.yaml` → check `acp_available`
2. If key is absent → probe via `/acp doctor`, cache result to `config.yaml`
3. If `acp_default_mode == "never"` → force Inline Mode regardless

```yaml
# In ./bmad/config.yaml (entirely optional — omitting = Inline Mode)
acp_available: false          # Auto-detected; can be overridden
acp_default_mode: "auto"     # "auto" | "always" | "never"
```

### Spawn Decision Matrix

workflow does **not** spawn an ACP agent for every role. The decision is **deterministic** — same inputs always produce the same spawn/inline decision:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Role needs **file I/O** the current LLM cannot perform | **Spawn ACP** |
| Task is **long-running** (full test suite, large refactor) | **Spawn ACP** |
| Task is **short/simple** (status read, quick analysis, < 20 LOC) | **Inline** |
| User explicitly passes `--acp` or `--inline` flag | **Honor the flag** |
| Previous inline attempt **failed or hit token limits** | **Escalate to ACP** |
| Multiple roles can work **in parallel** | **Spawn ACP** for each |
| ACP spawn fails | **Retry once**, then fall back to Inline silently |

### Role-to-Harness Mapping

| workflow Role | Default Harness | Permission | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Developer | `codex` | `approve-all` | File I/O, build tools, multi-file stories |
| Tester | `codex` | `approve-all` | Test execution, deps install, screenshots |
| Designer | `claude` | `approve-reads` | Creative CSS/HTML, new files only |
| Architect | `claude` | `approve-reads` | Deep reasoning, codebase-wide analysis |
| Reviewer | `codex` or `claude` | `approve-reads` | Linters + reasoning; never modifies files |
| PM | `claude` | `approve-all` | PRD generation, large decomposition |
| Scrum Master | `claude` | `approve-reads` | Sprint planning, status-patch output |

Override in `./bmad/config.yaml`:
```yaml
acp_harness_map:
  Developer: codex
  Tester: codex
  Designer: gemini    # any installed harness
```

### Spawn Payload Shape

All ACP spawns use `sessions_spawn` with `runtime: "acp"`:

```jsonc
{
  "task": "[<Role> - <AgentName>] <description>.\nRead: <context files>\nOutput: bmad/artifacts/acp-<role>-<id>.md\nDo NOT write to status.yaml.",
  "runtime": "acp",
  "agentId": "<harness>",
  "thread": true,
  "mode": "run",
  "permissionMode": "<from mapping>",
  "nonInteractivePermissions": "deny",
  "streamTo": "parent",
  "cwd": "<project root>",
  "label": "<Role>-<id>"
}
```

**Rules:**
- `runtime` MUST be `"acp"` (default is `subagent`)
- `mode: "session"` requires `thread: true` — use for long test suites only
- Artifact naming: `acp-<role>-<story-id>.md` — strict, predictable globs
- Developer artifacts MUST include a **file change manifest** (touched files + LOC delta)
- Reviewer/Tester artifacts MUST have `result: pass | fail | partial` on line 1
- No ACP session writes `status.yaml` — Orchestrator merges artifacts/patches

### Session Tracking

Active ACP sessions are recorded in `./bmad/active-agents.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "ACP-Sessions": [
    {
      "sessionKey": "agent:codex:acp:<uuid>",
      "role": "Developer",
      "agentName": "Alex",
      "harness": "codex",
      "story": "S2-03",
      "status": "running",
      "spawnedAt": "2026-04-05T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

On completion: read output artifact → update `status.yaml` → release agent name → chain to next role.

### Fallback Chain

```
ACP spawn → (fail) → Retry once → (fail) → Inline Mode (no change to existing behavior)
```

Spawn failures are logged to `bmad/bmad-openspace.md` but never block the workflow. The Orchestrator always has a path forward.

### Scrum Master: status-patch.yaml

The Scrum Master cannot write `status.yaml` directly in ACP context. Instead it outputs `bmad/status-patch.yaml` (changed fields only). The Orchestrator validates and merges it — preventing ACP corruption of the state machine.

## What You Say (User Interface)

These are the only commands you need. workflow handles everything else automatically.

| You Say | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `workflow init <project>` | Create project structure, ready to start |
| `workflow continue` | Keep working: implement stories, write tests, chain to next step automatically |
| `workflow status` / `workflow what's next` | **Display** cached `status.md` — no regeneration. |
| `workflow analyze` | **Rebuild** `status.yaml` + `status.md` from scratch by scanning the project. Use when status is stale or missing. |
| `workflow test` | Run unit and e2e tests. E2E failures are hard blockers only if a matching unit test also fails |
| `workflow audit` | Check code quality and surface issues |
| `workflow doc` | Generate/update project docs and README |
| `workflow continue --acp` | Force ACP spawn for the next role |
| `workflow continue --inline` | Force inline execution even if ACP is available |
| `workflow acp status` | Show active ACP sessions |
| `workflow acp doctor` | Run ACP health check |
| `workflow acp close <label>` | Close a named ACP session |

**That's it. Everything else (planning, sprints, stories, role assignments, test orchestration, ACP spawning) happens automatically behind the scenes.**

---

## How workflow Works (Internal)

These internal directives are carried out by workflow as needed. **You never invoke them directly** — workflow executes them automatically.

| Internal Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `workflow snapshot` | Save timestamped copy of `status.yaml` to `artifacts/history/` |
| `workflow connector` | Generate `artifacts/connector.yml` manifest |
| `workflow config set/get/unset` | Manage skill configuration overrides |
---

## Roles

Each skill command has a corresponding **role** — a contextual lens that shapes how the model approaches the task. Role files are in `references/roles/` and must be read before executing skill commands.

| Role | File | Commands |
|------|------|----------|
| **PM** | `references/roles/pm.md` | `plan prd`, `plan spec` |
| **Architect** | `references/roles/architect.md` | `plan arch`, `analyze` |
| **Developer** | `references/roles/dev.md` | `dev story`, `fix` , `continue` |
| **Reviewer** | `references/roles/reviewer.md` | `dev review`, `audit` |
| **Tester** | `references/roles/tester.md` | `test unit`, `test e2e` |
| **Scrum Master** | `references/roles/scrum.md` | `sprint`, `sprint story`, `next`, `status` |
| **Designer** | `references/roles/designer.md` | `doc` (UI docs), component design, CSS/HTML tasks |

`readme` has no role — use project context directly.

### Role Activation Checklist

Follow these steps **in order** every time you execute a skill command:

0. **[ACP] Check ACP capability** — Read `./bmad/config.yaml` → `acp_available`. If key is absent, probe via `/acp doctor` and cache the result. If `acp_default_mode == "never"` → force Inline Mode regardless.
1. **Read `./bmad/status.yaml` now** — This is mandatory, not optional. Read the actual file from the project's current directory. If it doesn't exist, run `workflow init` and stop. If it exists, extract: phase, progress, next_action, next_command, next_role. Do not proceed without real data from this file — no assumptions about its contents.
2. **Read `./bmad/bmad-openspace.md`** — if it exists, read it to check for coordination notes from other roles. If it doesn't exist, skip this step (you may create it later if needed).
2b. **Read `./bmad/conventions.md`** — if it exists, read it to know project conventions. Respect all listed conventions during your work. If it doesn't exist, skip.
3. **[ACP] Spawn decision** — If `acp_available == true` AND `acp_default_mode != "never"`: apply the Spawn Decision Matrix (see ACP Sub-Agent Mode section). If decision = spawn → issue `sessions_spawn`, track in `active-agents.json`, await artifact, then skip to step 8. If decision = inline → continue to step 4.
4. **Pick your agent name** — Read `references/roles/identities/agent-names.md` and select an **unused name** from your role's pool. Sign all your entries with `[Role - Name]` (e.g., `[Developer - Léo]`). If `./bmad/active-agents.json` exists, check which names are already taken for this session.
5. **Check `references/overrides.json`** — if the file exists, read it. If not, skip to step 6.
   - If `role.<name>.prompt` exists for this role: note it (you'll prepend it in step 6)
   - If `role.<name>.ref` exists: note the file path (you'll read it **in addition to** the role file)
5. **Read the role file** from `references/roles/<name>.md`
  - **If the role file is not found:** Look in `config/roles.yaml` for a `roles.<name>.file` mapping
  - **If still not found:** Report as hard blocker — cannot continue without role definition
6. **If overrides were found in step 2:**
   - Prepend `role.<name>.prompt` text before the role instructions
   - Read the file at `role.<name>.ref` as additional context
7. **Read the role file** from `references/roles/<name>.md`
8. **Print role tag:** First line of response must be **[PM]**, **[Architect]**, **[Developer]**, **[Reviewer]**, **[Tester]**, **[Scrum Master]**, or **[Designer]**
9. **Execute the command** following the role's perspective, priorities, and output format. Perform at least one concrete action (see "Action guarantee" above) before producing non-actionable proposals.
10. **Update project state (CRITICAL for Chain Protocol):** Modify the project's `./bmad/status.yaml` to reflect:
   - `active_role` = current role
   - `next_action` = human-readable description
   - `next_command` = executable command (must match next_role)
   - `next_role` = which role executes next (must match next_command)
   - `progress` when work meaningfully advances
   - **Validation:** Ensure `next_command` and `next_role` are in sync (see Validation Rules table above). Inconsistency breaks the chain.
   - **How to write:** Use the filesystem directly; do NOT use engine.mjs for writes.

### Roles Autonomy Rule

**Roles execute tasks, not conduct interviews.** When you have context (status.yaml + role file + project state), decide and act. Document assumptions with `> Assumed:` at the top of your response.

**When to ask vs. decide:**
- **Decide alone** if: project context is available, decision is about implementation details, or the user gave direction earlier
- **Ask only if** you cannot possibly infer the next step from available context (rare — status.yaml usually makes it clear)

**End of task:** Always follow [DONE:]/[NEXT:] format. Chain to the next action — this is not optional.

---

## status.yaml Schema

Models must read and update this file. **Complete schema with validation rules: see `references/status-yaml-validation.md`**

**Key fields to manage:**
- `next_action` — human-readable description of next step
- `next_command` — executable command (e.g. "workflow continue", "workflow sprint")
- `next_role` — who executes next (must match next_command) **[CRITICAL: must stay in sync]**
- `progress` — update when work meaningfully advances
- `phase`, `active_role`, `artifacts`, `sprints` — maintain as tasks progress

**Story ID format:** `S{sprint number}-{sequence:02d}`. Example: sprint 1, story 3 = `S1-03`. Sprint 12, story 1 = `S12-01`.

**When to update:** At the **end** of every skill command. Update `status.yaml` first (including `marketing`, `product`, `far_vision` dimensions), then generate `status.md`. Verify the yaml after writing. At minimum update `active_role`, `next_action`, and the three dimensions. Update `progress` and `phase` when work meaningfully advances the project.

---

## Flags

- `--pause`: Stop the chain after the current task. Use this if the user explicitly asked you to stop after one step.
- `--code`: Modifier for `audit` — focus on code quality only.

## Execution Honesty Rule

**Never report results you have not actually obtained.**

**Specifically forbidden:**
- ❌ "tests pass" — if you didn't actually run `workflow test`
- ❌ "application works" — if you didn't actually test it
- ❌ "no conflicts" — if you didn't actually build/merge
- ❌ "you can test it" — implies YOU haven't tested it
- ❌ "should work" — assumption, not evidence
- ❌ "likely no issues" — speculation, not verification

**Required honesty:**
- ✅ "tests executed, output: `bmad/artifacts/test-report-S1-01.md`, result: 142/142 pass"
- ✅ "build completed, no errors, artifact: `dist/app.js`"
- ✅ "merge conflict detected in `file.ts`, resolved by [method]"
- ✅ "E2E test failed: `test.spec.ts:45` — investigating"

**This rule is non-negotiable.** Violating it breaks the Chain Protocol trust and blocks deployment reliability.

## status.yaml — Story Test Fields (REQUIRED)

**Every story in `status.yaml` MUST include test tracking fields:**

```yaml
sprints:
  - number: 1
    goal: "Sprint goal here"
    status: in_progress
    stories:
      - id: S1-01
        title: "Story title"
        status: in_progress | complete | blocked
        tests_executed: true | false    # REQUIRED — false by default
        test_output: null | "bmad/artifacts/test-report-S1-01.md"  # REQUIRED if complete
        test_result: null | pass | fail | partial  # REQUIRED if tests_executed: true

      - id: S1-02
        title: "Another story"
        status: complete
        tests_executed: true
        test_output: "bmad/artifacts/test-report-S1-02.md"
        test_result: pass
```

**Validation rules:**
- `status: complete` → REQUIRES `tests_executed: true` AND `test_result: pass`
- `tests_executed: false` → `status` CANNOT be `complete`
- `test_output` MUST exist if `tests_executed: true`
- Test report artifact MUST contain actual test runner output (not assumed)

**Enforcement:**
- workflow Orchestrator validates these fields before allowing chain to continue
- Story marked complete without tests = **hard blocker**
- Tester role MUST sign off (via test report) before Developer can close story

## Chain Protocol Trust Rule (CRITICAL)

**See `references/status-yaml-validation.md` for detailed validation rules.**

In brief: `next_command` and `next_role` MUST stay in sync. Inconsistency = chain breaks = hard blocker.

---

The only valid reason to stop is a **hard blocker**: a required file is missing, a command fails with an unrecoverable error, inconsistent `next_command`/`next_role`, or the user explicitly wrote "stop", "pause", or "wait". In that case, report the specific blocker — do not ask for general guidance.

## Inter-Agent Communication & Agent Identities

**Full reference:** Read `references/roles/identities/agent-identities.md` for openspace format, rules, and integration.
**Name pools:** Read `references/roles/identities/agent-names.md` to pick a unique agent name for your session.

---

## Project Conventions: conventions.md

**Purpose:** Track project-wide conventions discovered or decided during development. Any role can append conventions when a pattern, rule, or decision emerges that should be respected going forward.

**Location:** `./bmad/conventions.md` (create if missing on first convention)

**Format:**
```markdown
# Conventions — <project-name>

## Language & Communication
- Openspace discussions are written in English

## Code Style
- Component files use PascalCase
- All API responses use snake_case keys

## Architecture
- No direct DB access from route handlers — use service layer

## Testing
- E2E tests cover all critical user flows before release
```

**Rules:**
1. **Append-only** — never remove existing conventions without explicit user approval
2. **Categorize** — group conventions under meaningful headers
3. **Keep concise** — one line per convention, no prose
4. **Read before coding** — every role reads `conventions.md` at activation (if it exists)
5. **Write when:** a decision, pattern, or rule is established that affects how the project should be developed
6. **Breaking changes** — when a convention changes, annotate with `**Breaking change:**` in `bmad-openspace.md`

**Name Selection:** See `references/roles/identities/agent-names.md` for the name pool system. Each role has 8 unique names. Pick an unused name for your session.

## What This Skill Is NOT
- Does NOT invent tools or functions
- Does NOT pretend to create files it doesn't really create
- Does NOT require reference files for shell commands (role files cover all skill commands)
