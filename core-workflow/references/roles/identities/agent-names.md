## Usage

**In DISCUSSION.md, sign with:** `[Role - Name] — YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`

Example:
```markdown
## [Developer - Léo] — 2026-04-04 18:30
Starting work on S3-02...

## [Tester - Mathis] — 2026-04-04 18:45
Waiting for Developer fix...
```

## Name Tracking

Names in use should be tracked in `./bmad/active-agents.json` (created automatically):

```json
{
  "session-2026-04-04": {
    "Developer": ["Léo", "Manon"],
    "Tester": ["Mathis"],
    "Architect": ["Aurélien"]
  }
}
```

When a sub-agent completes its task, its name is released back to the pool.
